Problem #1. All the fastQC and trimmomatic output files are under the corresponding folders under 'Week_2'. The fastQC output after running trimmomatic were saved under folder 'trimmomatic'. 
Something interesting I saw is that the fastQC files after trimmomatic were divided into four different files: forward paired and unpaired, and reverse paired and unpaired. And the fastQC on unpaired outputs showed lower QC scores.

Please ignore the bwa_RNA_output directory, I accidentally used bwa for RNA-seq data.
